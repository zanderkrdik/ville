#Ville

A rudimentary code palace, where code lives in different states. 

##Chapter 1: Genesis

At first came darkness. 

Then form was spun from nothingness by the creator.

```
gulp
    sass
    sprites
browsersync
```    

##Chapter 2: Time

The creator gave us Light, and we were able to see the world emege from darkness. 

``` 
gulp default
```

`http://localhost:3000` lights up, as per our gulpfile.js.
